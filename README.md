# Coding Challenge
## Challenge 1: Sum of Multiples
Problem Statement:
Write a function named sum_of_multiples that takes two integers: n and x. The function should return the sum of all multiples of x that are less than or equal to n.

**Examples:**

- If n = 20 and x = 5, the function should return 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50.
- If n = 15 and x = 3, the function should return 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= x <= 100

### Function Signature:
```
def sum_of_multiples(n: int, x: int) -> int:
    pass
```
